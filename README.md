# Mission to mars!


## Overview of analysis
This week we had the oppurtunity to help Robin gather a ton of information for her database. Using Beautiful soup and SPlinter, we scraped full resolution images of the glorious red planet. After successfully scraping we we used MOngo database to hold our information and used Flask to display the data.

Welcome to mars!
